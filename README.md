# crystal-fragments
A collection of trivial programs demonstrating various features of the Crystal language.

Crystal can be installed from https://crystal-lang.org/docs/installation/index.html.

Once installed each program can be executed using the command:

	crystal [scriptname]

Documentation on Crystal is available at:

	https://crystal-lang.org/docs/
	https://crystal-lang.org/api/0.19.4/

Both the syntax and the APIs will look familiar if you've previously used Ruby.
